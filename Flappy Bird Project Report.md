1. Executive Summary
Overview:
This project recreates the Flappy Bird game using C++ and the Qt framework, applying
Object-Oriented Programming principles. The main tasks included designing class
hierarchies, implementing the game loop, and integrating graphical elements.
Key Findings:
The team successfully implemented a playable version of the game, demonstrating
encapsulation, inheritance, and modular design.

3. Introduction
Background:
The project was chosen to apply core OOP concepts in a practical and interactive setting. It
reinforces the use of classes, objects, and events.
Project Objectives:
To develop a game that involves real-time interactivity and demonstrates OOP features such
as class hierarchies, polymorphism, and event handling.

5. Project Description
Scope:
Included: Player character (bird), obstacles (pipes), scoring, collision detection, GUI.
Excluded: Advanced AI, online features.
Technical Overview:
Tools used: C++, Qt Creator 16.0.1, Qt framework for UI and graphics.

7. Methodology
Approach:
The project followed weekly milestones for incremental development and integration.
Roles and Responsibilities:
Yahya Salman: Bird and Game logic
Muhammad Irfan: Pipe generation and collision
Abdul Rafay: GUI design and integration

9. Project Implementation
Design and Structure:
The game is organized into multiple classes for each major component—bird, pipes, game
window, etc.
Functionalities Developed:
• Bird movement and gravity
• Pipe movement and random generation
• Collision detection
• Score counter
• Restart and game-over logic
Challenges Faced:
Integrating real-time graphics with collision logic was initially tricky. Timers and event
handling were carefully tuned to maintain performance.

11. Results
Project Outcomes:
A fully functioning Flappy Bird clone was created with a basic GUI and sound logic.
Testing and Validation:
Each component was unit tested, and the full game was run multiple times to ensure
functionality and stability.

13. Conclusion
Summary of Findings:
The project fulfilled its objectives by using OOP techniques to develop an interactive game.
Final Remarks:
This project was a valuable experience in team collaboration, software design, and real-time
application development.
